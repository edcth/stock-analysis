- selling to close does not turn into profit event

Feedback:
not sure if it makes sense or not, but if I want to track how I'm doing, I trade with an initial bankroll, and then the trades can be measured on a percentage
like, this position is 50% of your total bankroll
when you exit a position, you gained xx% in your total bankroll
or something like that

Profit/Loss
- FSLR bug, sold CALL for 53 for 100, bought it for 10 to close out, only counting 10 debit
- show total options transactions
- assignment rate
- expired worthless
- closed at profit rate
- % return of premium

- collateral held bug
- premium bug

Watch concept
- create watch, alert when close is at -%10 +%10,

- breakdown by industry, by microcap


- transactions: row type with pl and tx options
    - selling option to close position is a PL event test
    - expiring option is a PL event test
    - buying option to close positin is a PL event test
    - selling shares is a PL event test

- review collapse notes with counts instead of listing them all

MARKETING

"How do I know how much I have made or lost 
if the graph doesnâ€™t include realised gain/loss? 
Is there a way to calculate that quickly 
or I have to go through the statement each month 
and manually input in excel sheet lol?"
